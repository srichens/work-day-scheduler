# Work Day Scheduler
Bootcamp Week 5 Challenge

## This weekâ€™s bootcamp challenge for Third Party APIs was to modify starter code for a simple calendar app using Day.js with the following criteria:
1. The current date is displayed at the top.

2. Time blocks on the calendar are color coded for past, present, and future.

3. Any entries typed into each time block are saved in local storage at the click of a button and also remain on the calendar when the page is refreshed.

## My notes on the process:

1. I originally tried to use a single loop function to save each text input to local storage, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work (at least, not in the time I had). The tutor I worked with got me part of the way there, but suggested that saving everything individually would be easier, so in the end, I did that. 

2. I also wanted to try to render the text back to the page with some sort of easy loop function, and I'm sure there's also some way to do that, but I settled for doing everything individually again. 

3. I did not add anything that would reset the calendar on a new day, but that would have been a good add if I'd had time.
